- 👋 Hi, I’m @Fortunbas
- 👀 I’m interested in online game protection coding against cheating (Anticheat) and hosting hybrid private/public content delivery network (CDN) against ddos attacks for gamers in particular for Titanfall 1 and 2. I am a registered CISSP.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to host a VPN (Token based) CDN gaming network to combat DDOS and ban cheaters. I am looking to create a gaming network with 3 strike community based game masters(voted on a 3 month basis). I am also looking to leverage machine learning to combat cheaters where the community game masters will be able to override on false positives that can be dialed up and down as necessary.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on hosting these networks and building a platform that can deliver these objectives. I have a dedicated 100mb leased line to the internet that is doing nada right now.
